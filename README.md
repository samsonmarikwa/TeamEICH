# I'm new here

I'm new here is a Team Eich project. We collaborated as a four member team to come up with an idea to help a person who has arrived in a new place and needs to hit the ground running using technology. A user is able to find some activities to do in the area.

You start by entering a city or zipcode. You can also enter a specific address of your current position. An dialog box showing the current weather is displayed on the webpage and from there you will be able to determine if you can have outdoor activities. You can then click the red icon which brings yet another dialog where you can specify the distance you want to travel from your current position to get to the activity place and the type of activities. Once you select these, you can then click the Submit button which displays a map. At this point, you are in google maps and you can then interact with google maps to check on your route, pictures of the area you intend to go and a google view scenery.


## Access the application
You can access the application on [Heroku](https://serene-forest-57972.herokuapp.com) on the Portfolio link.


## Setup

You can download the code to your machine. You will need to create your own credentials on [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and replace line 5 to 10 in the api.js file with your own firebase config.
